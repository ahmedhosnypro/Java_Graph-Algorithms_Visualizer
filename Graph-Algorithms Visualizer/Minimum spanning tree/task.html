<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>In the final stage of the project, we will take a look at two crucial concepts. The first one is the <strong>spanning tree </strong>notion. The graph theory determines the spanning tree <code class="java">T</code> of the undirected graph <code class="java">G</code> as a tree subgraph that includes <strong>all vertices </strong>of <code class="java">G</code>. In general, a graph can have several spanning trees, but a non-connected graph cannot have spanning trees. If all edges of <code class="java">G</code> are also the edges of the spanning tree <code class="java">T</code>, then <code class="java">G</code> is a tree identical to <code class="java">T</code> â€” a tree has a unique spanning tree that is itself by nature.</p>

<p>Another interesting concept for discussion is a <strong>minimum spanning tree</strong> (MST). It is a subset of the edges of a connected edge-weighted undirected graph. It connects all graph vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight without cycles. In other words, it is a spanning tree whose edge weight sum is the least possible.</p>

<p>In this stage, we will work on <strong>Prim's algorithm</strong> for a minimum spanning tree.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<p>Complete the following step to succeed in the final stage:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add Prim's Algorithm to the <code class="java">Algorithms</code> and name it <code class="java">Prim's Algorithm</code>;</li>
	<li>Keep the algorithms from the previous stage;</li>
	<li>The algorithm should produce a list of the <code class="java">&lt;Child&gt;=&lt;Parent&gt;</code> pairs separated by a comma in the display <code class="java">JLabel</code>. For example:<strong> </strong><code class="java">B=A, C=B, D=A</code>. It means that the parents of <code class="java">B</code>, <code class="java">C</code>, and <code class="java">D</code> in the minimum spanning tree are <code class="java">A</code>, <code class="java">B</code>, and <code class="java">A</code> respectively. It should be displayed in alphabetical order.</li>
</ol>

        Hint
      </button>
      <div id="hint-1822" style="display:none;">We advise you to test your code architecture for extensibility in this stage. You may also make the unused edge disappear after running Prim's algorithm. Don't remove them and don't forget to bring them back later.</div></p>
